## What is Systems Design â€“ Learn System Design

Systems Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It involves translating user requirements into a detailed blueprint that guides the implementation phase. The goal is to create a well-organized and efficient structure that meets the intended purpose while considering factors like scalability, maintainability, and performance.

## Components of Systems Design
Below are some of the major components of the System Design. discussed in brief. The detailed version of this will be discussed in different posts:

* Load Balancers: Distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers to optimize performance and ensure reliability.
* Key-Value Stores: Storage systems that manage data as pairs of keys and values, often implemented using distributed hash tables.
* Blob Storage: A service for storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as media files (e.g., YouTube, Netflix).
* Databases: Organized collections of data that facilitate easy access, management, and modification.
* Rate Limiters: Control the maximum number of requests a service can handle in a given timeframe to prevent overload.
* Monitoring Systems: Tools that enable administrators to track and analyze infrastructure performance, including bandwidth and CPU usage.
* Distributed Messaging Queues: Mediums that facilitate communication between producers and consumers, ensuring reliable message delivery.
* Distributed Unique ID Generators: Systems that generate unique identifiers for events or tasks in a distributed environment.
* Distributed Search: Mechanisms that allow users to search across multiple data sources or websites for relevant information.
* Distributed Logging Services: Systems that collect and trace logs across services to monitor and troubleshoot applications.
* Distributed Task Schedulers: Tools that manage and allocate computational resources for executing tasks across a distributed system.
